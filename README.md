-- Remaking my personal web site in React. Was originally made and designed with Python Flask and HTML

-- The app will have a macro tracker for tracking users eating habits. A workout logger for entering and tracking workout history and TheBOARD. TheBOARD will serve as a place for clients/users to post their fitness accomplishments during their fitness journey.

-- MongoDB will be used to store data

-- Framer motion used for page animations

--  ChartJS for bar and Line graphs. Mainly used currently for the macro tracker. In the future I will add graphing for workouts to map out intensity and volume of training for more in depth analysis of progress and how the users workout programming is being applied in regards to progressive overload
